# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
A Kickstarter analysis to help maximize the success of a future campaign.
### Purpose
By analyzing a large number of Kickstarter campaigns in order to create a consice report for the client, we are able to deliver precise and accurate information in order for the client to make a informed decision on when to launch their own campaign to fund the play *Fever*. 
## Analysis and Challenges
- By filtering the data I was able to chart the following data shown in the images below.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- Challenges included making sure to desired information reflected in the code. Simple mistakes like copyinng formulas with out locking cells in the forumlas led to extrapolating incorrect/unwanted data leading to charts that didnt reflect the desired parameters.
## Results

- Based on the provided data, Theatre campaigns have the most success from April to August, peaking in May. Conclusions based on this would be to launch the campaign mid April to the first week in May for the best chances of full funding. Also that worst time to launch would be in October as roughly 77% of campaigns failed to be funded.


- Campaigns needed less than $1000 in funding have high rates of success however with increasing amounts for the goal, the likelihood of success decreases drastically. 

- Some limitations that are highlighted in the data are that it highlights the outlier datasets giving false impressions of the viability of a campaign requesting $35000-45000.

- The data may be further refined by determining sorting the funded plays into genres and determine the viability of different genre types.
